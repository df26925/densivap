A Fortran program that basically computes water vapour saturation pressure as a function of air temperature.
It can compute several atmospheric humidity parameters based on temperature and one humidity parameter.
It is based on Goff-Gratch formulation for water pressure vapour as a function of temperature.
For now, it does NOT take into account the effect of air in the water vapour saturation pressure.

A great source of info on water vapour pressure formulations can be foun on a webpage completely UNRELATED to this project: http://cires1.colorado.edu/~voemel/vp.html
